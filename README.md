Ginto8's .vim directory
=======================

A craftsman is nothing without his tools, and Vim is one of mine. I
have been tweaking this configuration for a very long time, and it
serves me quite well.

Installing
----------

Installation comes in two steps. First, run .vim/setup.sh

    # Installs to <path> if non-empty, otherwise to $HOME
    $ /path/to/.vimrc/setup.sh <path>

Then run `:BundleInstall` in vim, and you're done!
